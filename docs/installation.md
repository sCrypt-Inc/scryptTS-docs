## The sCrypt CLI Tool

The [sCrypt CLI](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/scrypt-cli) tool is used to easily create, compile and publish `sCrypt` projects.
The CLI provides best practice project scaffolding including dependencies such as sCrypt, a test framework ([Mocha](https://mochajs.org)), code auto-formatting ([Prettier](https://prettier.io)), linting ([ES Lint](https://eslint.org)), and more.

Or install it globally on your machine.

```sh
npm install -g scrypt-cli
```

Run the CLI tool directly with `npx` and try it out by creating a demo project:

```sh
npx scrypt-cli project demo
```

:::tip
You can also fork the [demo contract on Repl.it](https://replit.com/@msinkec/scryptTS-demo) and play with the code in your browser.
